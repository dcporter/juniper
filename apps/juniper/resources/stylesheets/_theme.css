/*
  This defines the global $theme variable for use inside your CSS.
  The $theme variable holds the CSS class names for your theme.
  
  You can then theme your app by using CSS like this:

      $theme.button {
        color: blue;
        @include slices('white-button.png', $left: 3, $right: 3);
      }
  
  Any _theme.css file is prepended to all files inside its directory,
  and any subdirectories that don't define their own _theme.css file.
  
  This allows you to give different directories different values for
  $theme if you wish.
