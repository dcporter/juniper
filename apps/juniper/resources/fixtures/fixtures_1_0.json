      "text": "Welcome to Juniper. Inspired by Vesper.\n\nThis is Juniper, a web app for taking and tagging notes. It&#8217;s inspired by Vesper, a beautiful iPhone note-taking app from Q-Branch, and published with permission. It&#8217;s built in SproutCore, the best framework for rich, native-caliber web apps. And it&#8217;s proof that with the right toolset, web apps can be just as beautiful as the best designs the iPhone has to offer.\n\nSo go ahead. Collect your thoughts. They&#8217;ll be here when you get back.",

      "text": "Built with SproutCore. Here&#8217;s why.\n\nThe world is full of people who know how to build great web pages. But those skills and best practices don&#8217;t translate well into the application space, and trying to make do so them means compromises.\n\nSproutCore doesn&#8217;t compromise, which means it has a serious learning curve. But that&#8217;s it&#8217;s power: On the other side of that curve is a true native-caliber, feature-rich, full-stack environment that encourages you to build web applications the same way you would build applications for a native platform. Which is how you get native-caliber applications, on the web. And it&#8217;s not as hard as you think. Juniper took fewer than 100 hours to build.\n\nSo check out the source code on GitHub. (The link is in the credits.) Check out my website (also in the credits). And if you&#8217;re looking to build a serious, native-caliber application on the web, poke around here to see what it can do, and then come have a look at SproutCore.\n\nIf you like this demo app and want the full-featured version, hop over to the App Store and check out Vesper. Tell &#8217;em the web sent you.",
